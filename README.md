# Pattern Sphere

This is part of the [Public Sphere Project](https://publicsphereproject.org).

The purpose of the Pattern Sphere (PS) is to support the use of
patterns and languages to help address difficult social and
environmental problems collaboratively. In fact, the user covenant
that registered users agree to stipulates that they use it that way.

Each "pattern" is a structured description of successful ideas and
actions. Patterns are general, not recipes with precise
instructions. They're intended to be adapted to meet the needs of the
people using them. This approach is not a cure-all and it's not
intended to replace other approaches. And the online approach that we
need hasn't been developed.

The pattern language approach was first presented in A Pattern
Language, a book devoted to human structures that promote beauty and
life that contains 253 patterns. The Liberating Voices book has 136
patterns and each pattern, from Civic Intelligence to Retreat and
Reflection, focuses on positive social change.

The PS is intended to support people throughout the entire life-cycle
of social change activities from creating new patterns and commenting
on existing patterns to using patterns to develop new projects. As the
PS provides more services, people, working individually or on teams,
will be able to find patterns, select patterns to use, annotate
patterns (for their own use or to help others), create new patterns,
brainstorm with patterns, join teams, etc. etc. We also plan to offer
alternative ways for people to perform each of these tasks — knowing
that people have different styles and take different approaches.

Our work thus far on the PS system has been to develop services on an
as-needed basis. Currently, individuals and teams can select patterns
and comment on them which is translated into a group assessment. We
have worked with the two groups listed below, the Limits Workshops
community and the Poetry and Permaculture class of the Comparative
History of Ideas (CHID) department at the University of Washington.

If patterns and pattern languages are to have any lasting and tangible
effects, many capabilities need to be further developed, including
federated pattern language repositories, support for collaboration,
team workspaces, search capabilities, pattern sharing, etc. Developing
this system will require the work of many people: UI/UX designers, PHP
/ MySQL programmers, testers, pattern and pattern language experts,
community development, outreach, and others. Specific tasks include:

- User interface — to replace what you see here
- Importing patterns or pattern info
- Designing and implementing process flows for pattern uses
- Experimenting with and testing new approaches
- Involving various communities in pattern deployment and development
- Helping to manage the development effort
